This package contains the UX core system headers. Specifically, it
includes:

stdarg.h
stdbool.h
stddef.h
stdint.h
sys/types.h

It also includes a number of private headers, in the 'ux' subdirectory.
These private headers are strictly not to be included directly by user
applications.

All of the included headers install to ${includedir}, which defaults to
${prefix}/include (which itself defaults to /usr/local).

Unless you know precisely what you are doing, do not install these
headers on top of your existing system-provided headers: you will
almost certainly break your compilation environment.

See ux/README for an explanation of the private headers, particularly
if you are porting UX to a new architecture or kernel.
